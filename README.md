It is important to read and install the requirements to be able to run the AI.

In this lab, a simple but functional chatbot was created. A chatbot is like a computer program that can chat with you based on text. It uses something called a transformer, which is like its brain. Inside this brain, there is a language model that helps it understand and generate responses like a person would make. This model has learned from many human conversations to respond coherently.

When a message is sent to the chatbot, the transformer helps it process your message. It breaks the message into smaller parts called tokens, which are like pieces that the chatbot can understand. These tokens are sent to a language model, which has been trained with lots of textual information. This model has learned language patterns and meanings from all that data.

Once the language model understands the message, it generates a response based on that understanding. The transformer then takes that response and converts it into a format that it can easily send back to you. This process is repeated every time you have a new interaction with the chatbot. Thus, the transformer and the language model work together to process your message, understand the context and generate a relevant response.

The important thing is that the language model learns from a lot of textual information to understand language patterns and generate responses that make sense. The transformer helps with the technical aspects of processing and representing input/output data, allowing the language model to focus on understanding and generating language effectively.

Once the chatbot understands the message, it uses the language model to generate a response that it thinks will be useful or interesting to you. It sends you that response, and so the process continues while you and the chatbot have a back-and-forth conversation.
